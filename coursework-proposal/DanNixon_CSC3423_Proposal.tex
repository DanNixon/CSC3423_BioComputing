\begin{abstract}
  This document describes the choices I have made for the two bio inspired
  algorithms, their parameters and knowledge representation that will be used to
  solve the given classification problem.
\end{abstract}

\section{Genetic algorithm}

The first algorithm I have chosen is a genetic algorithm using a hyperrectangle
classifier.

The advantages of the genetic algorithm is its ability to work with a wide range
of optimisation and machine learning problems this is inherently because the
algorithm itself does not have knowledge of the problem it is trying to solve,
instead it operates by making small random changes to a population of candidate
solutions.

This property also allows the algorithm to remain unchanged as the
classification problem it is solving increases to higher dimensions.

\subsection{Knowledge Representation}

The knowledge representation I will use is a hyperrectangle. For a
classification problem in $n$ dimensions a classifier will be stored as an
origin position in $n$ dimensions and a length in each dimension as shown for a
three dimensional classifier in figure \ref{fig:alg1_kr}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{out/alg1_kr.eps}
  \caption{3D hyperrectangle classifier}
  \label{fig:alg1_kr}
\end{figure}

The advantage of the hyperrectangle classifier is that it is a very small data
set, in a classification problem its is a set of upper and lower bounds for each
dimension of the problem.

The simplicity of this knowledge representation also significantly simplifies
and increases the speed of computation in other stages of the genetic algorithm,
namely selection and crossover.

During selection the fitness function for each chromosome must be calculated, as
with a hyperrectangle classifier this involves simply determining if a given
instance is within all bounds of the classifier this operation is very
computationally inexpensive.

During crossover two new children can derived using the blend alpha
(BLX-$\mathrm{\alpha}$) function described by Takahashi and Kita \cite{blxa},
which is again an inexpensive operation due to the simplicity of the knowledge
representation.

\subsection{Implementation}

When a new classifier is created it will take a random size within the bounding
box of the instances in the current training set, the size will be determined
independently for each axis and will be selected using a linear distribution
from values between a minimum percentage of the axis length (which is a
parameter of the system) and the axis length.

Equation \ref{eq:blxa} shows the implementation that will be used for the
BLX-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ crossover function to determine a parameter of classifier
$x^{c}$ (a child of classifiers $x^{a}$ and $x^{b}$) \cite{blxa}.

\begin{align*}
  x^{c}_{i} &\in [X^{a}_{i}, X^{b}_{i}] \\
  X^{a}_{i} &= min(x^{a}_{i}, x^{a}_{i}) - \alpha d_{i} \\
  X^{b}_{i} &= max(x^{b}_{i}, x^{b}_{i}) + \alpha d_{i} \\
  d_{i} &= |x^{1}_{i} - x^{2}_{i}|
  \numberthis
  \label{eq:blxa}
\end{align*}
